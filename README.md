# mATX Case

This repository contains parts for constructing a small (~15L) mATX compatible computer case. It contains both parts which need to be printed, and parts which need to be laser cut.

## Motivation

Ever since I was able to hold a drill, I wanted to make my own computer case. Now, 20 years later, thanks to innovation in 3D printing and laser cutting, it has become trivial to build your own computer case.

In addition, I travel quite a bit and I wanted a computer that was small. Most computer cases are big because of the flexibility it affords. However, being able to print your own case, you can design it specifically for the parts you have in mind. That allows many areas for optimising space.

- ... more stuff ...
